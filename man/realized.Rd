\title{Extracts the realized autozygosity from the zres object}
\usage{
realized(zres, classNum = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{zres}{The name of the zres object created by the zoorun function.}

\item{classNum}{An array with the number of the classes to extract. All
classes are extracted by default.}
}
\value{
The function returns a data frame with one row per individual and one
 column per extracted classes. In addition, it gives names to the columns.
 For a pre-defined model, the names of HBD classes are "R_X" where X is the
 rate of the corresponding class. For a model with rate estimation, the names
 of the HBD classes are "HBDclassX" where X is the number of the HBD class.
 For non-HBD classes, we use "NonHBD".
}
\description{
Extracts the realized autozygosity from the zres object. Extraction is
performed for the indicated classes (all by default) and names are added to
the columns. The function must be used with more than one individual is the
zres object.
